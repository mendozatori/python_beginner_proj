# Rainfall Report
This beginner python application prints out a report to the
console based on the user input. It first prompts you to enter
how many years of rainfall to calculate for then allows the 
user to enter the amount of rainfall for each month and year.
The console will then print a summary that includes the total
number of months, total inches of rainfall, and the average 
rainfall per month.
