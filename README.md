# Grade Calculation Application

This application can calculate the grade a student will get 
based on a weighted scale. This application can take 3 assignments,
2 quizzes and a midterm. Assignments are 25%, quizzes are 30% 
and the Mid-Term is 45% of the overall grade. The user will
input their scores for each assignment (100 pts), quiz (25 pts)
 and mid-term (50 pts). The program should display the average
 score of each type as well as the overall grade in the course.
